    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm Gerald Mulwa, a goal-oriented and passionate Electrical Engineering Technology student at Meru University of Science and Technology, 
      with a strong foundation in both hands-on technical work and digital innovation. As a proud Kenyan of Kamba heritage and a devoted Christian, 
      my principles of honesty, discipline, and purpose-driven living deeply influence my personal and professional journey.</p>
    <p>With over two years of experience as an electrical technician and freelance graphic designer, I've cultivated a diverse skill set that 
      bridges physical systems with creative digital solutions. My interests lie at the intersection of smart energy systems, artificial intelligence, 
      and web development — areas where I believe technology can have a powerful, transformative impact on our communities.</p>
    <p>Outside of academics and work, I am a certified peer counselor and public speaker, committed to youth mentorship and leadership development. 
      I am also a dedicated Taekwondo martial artist, a discipline that has strengthened my resilience, focus, and teamwork — qualities I carry into
       every project I pursue.</p>
    <p>I continue to grow in the fields of engineering, technology and design, I remain guided by my faith, driven by curiosity, and committed to 
      using my skills to create meaningful solutions that serve both people and purpose.
